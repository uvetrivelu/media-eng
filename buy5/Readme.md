###ProblemDefinition
    Application / Architeture Design: buy5.com (45 minutes)
    Design a single-page e-commerce web app for ‘buy5.com’ where users can purchase
    5 items of a given product.
    Products should have descriptions and categories. The single-page-app should
    present a user with a list of products, each of which can be purchased with a
    single button-click.
    Your output should document the following:
    • System architecture diagram (you may use draw.io)
    • Tech stack
    • RESTful API endpoints
    • RESTful API sample request / response payloads
    – What format would they be in?
    – Don’t need to provide examples for every operation. Just one for
    each type of operation. For example, if there are some endpoints
    supporting search, provide one example for search. If there are
    endpoints supporting create, provide one example for create.
    • Application internal architecture diagram
    – This more speaks to internal code modules within the application
    • Sequence diagram of a user purchase
    
###Deliverables
    
    - The "buy5" folder contains System Architecture, Tech Stack Architecture, Internal Architecture Component Diagram & Order Purchase Sequence Diagram.
    - All diagram artifacts are in PDF format named in self explanatory way. (The XML files are artifacts for importing through draw.io)
    - In the architecture I have omitted components like PaymentService, InventoryService, AccountService, EmailService etc to keep the scope limited and to address the problem within given timelines.
